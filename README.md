[The head direction circuit of two insect species, eLife, 2020.](https://elifesciences.org/articles/53985)
This paper analyses and derives the underlying head direction neuronal circuit of two insect species, the fruit fly and the desert locust.

[Anesthesia disrupts distance, but not direction, of path integration memory, Current Biology, 2022.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0960982221015980)
This paper studies the effect of cooling on the path integration memory of ants and shows that the distance is affected by cooling but the direction survives. 

[Can the Insect Path Integration Memory be a Bump Attractor?, bioRxiv, 2022.](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.04.05.487126)
This paper studies whether bump attractors are a plaussible model of insect path integration.
